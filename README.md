# zFi dApp

This is the zFi dApp, ported from zNS-dapp's "DAOs zApp" app.

## Running Locally

This app currently only runs in the context of [zNS-dapp](https://github.com/zer0-os/zNS-dapp) and [zOS](https://github.com/zer0-os/zOS).

To get this running in either of the above contexts, you will need to either build this package and import it, or use `npm link`.
